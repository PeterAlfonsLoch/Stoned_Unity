Adding a new SavableObject whose GameObject gets Spawned during Runtime:
1. Make sure your MonoBehaviour that needs to save a memory is a subtype of SavableMonoBehaviour
2. Add getSavableObject() method
3. Add acceptSavableObject() method
4. Go to SavableObject.getSavableMonobehaviourType() and add a case statement for the new type, copying the new SavableMonoBehaviour’s name verbatim from the source code
5. Add isSpawnedObject() method and return true
6. Add getPrefabName() method and return the name of the prefab for this script’s object
7. Make sure the prefab is located in the Assets/Resources folder and NOT in the Assets/Prefabs folder
