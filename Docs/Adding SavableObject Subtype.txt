Adding a new subtype of SavableObject:
1. Make sure your MonoBehaviour that needs to save a memory is a subtype of SavableMonoBehaviour
2. Add getSavableObject() method
3. Add acceptSavableObject() method
4. Go to SavableObject.getSavableMonobehaviourType() and add a case statement for the new type, copying the new SavableMonoBehaviour’s name verbatim from the source code
